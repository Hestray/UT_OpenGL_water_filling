# OpenGL-water-filling-objects
This is a simple interactive code written with OpenGL, meant to animate water filling a pipe and tank by opening or closing a valve. 
By pressing left click, the valve will open and let the water flow through the pipe into the tank. Pressing right click will close the valve and trap the water in place. The code is written in such a way that if the tank is filled with water, the valve can't be opened or closed anymore.
